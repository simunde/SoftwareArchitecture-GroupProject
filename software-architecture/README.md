# Fullscreen layout with columns

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/karolpodlesny/pen/kdJrVE](https://codepen.io/karolpodlesny/pen/kdJrVE).

Layout consists of five max-width columns and they adapt to the size of the screen. When column is clicked the fullscreen is applied. I decided to modify Mary Lou "Fullscreen layout with page transitions" tutorial which you can find here

I only changed the columns size parameters.
